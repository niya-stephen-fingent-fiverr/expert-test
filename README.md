## ðŸ§© Critical Fixes

### 1. Leads Not Saved & Duplicate Email Sent
**File:** `src/components/LeadCaptureForm.tsx`  
**Severity:** Critical  
**Status:** âœ… Resolved  

#### Issue
- Submitted lead data was **not** being stored in the Supabase `leads` table.
- The `send-confirmation` function was triggered twice, resulting in duplicate confirmation emails.

#### Cause
- `handleSubmit` lacked a call to insert lead data into the database.
- Redundant invocation of the confirmation email function.

#### Resolution
- Added a Supabase `insert` query to store lead data before triggering the email.
- Removed duplicate call to the email function.

#### Outcome
- âœ… Leads are now successfully saved  
- âœ… Confirmation emails are sent only once  
- âœ… Ensures accurate data capture and reduced email redundancy  
- âœ… Enhanced performance and system reliability

### 2. Incorrect Email Response Handling in Edge Function
**File:** `supabase/functions/send-confirmation/index.ts`  
**Severity:** Medium  
**Status:** âœ… Resolved  

#### Issue
- The confirmation email function was not properly accessing the `response ID` from the **Resend API**, making it difficult to verify successful email delivery or troubleshoot failures.

#### Cause
- Incorrect handling of the `emailResponse` object â€” `emailResponse.data?.id` was either not accessed or not logged correctly.

#### Resolution
- Updated the function to correctly access and log `emailResponse.data.id`.

#### Outcome
- âœ… Improved visibility into email delivery  
- âœ… Easier debugging and monitoring of confirmation emails  
- âœ… More dependable and transparent confirmation process

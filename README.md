ðŸ›  Bug Fixes Documentation
Overview
This document summarizes the key issues identified and resolved in the Lead Capture Form component.

ðŸ§© Critical Fixes

1. Leads Not Saved & Duplicate Email Sent
   File: src/components/LeadCaptureForm.tsx
   Severity: Critical
   Status: âœ… Resolved

Issue
Submitted lead data was not being stored in the Supabase leads table.
Additionally, the send-confirmation function was triggered twice, resulting in duplicate confirmation emails.

Cause
handleSubmit lacked a call to insert lead data into the database.

Redundant invocation of the confirmation email function.

Resolution
Added a Supabase insert query to store lead data in the leads table before triggering the email.

Removed the duplicate call to the email function.

Outcome
âœ… Leads are now successfully saved
âœ… Confirmation emails are sent only once
âœ… Ensures accurate data capture and reduced email redundancy
âœ… Enhanced performance and system reliability

2. Incorrect Email Response Handling in Edge Function
   File: supabase/functions/send-confirmation/index.ts
   Severity: Medium
   Status: âœ… Resolved

Issue
The confirmation email function was not properly accessing the response ID from the Resend API, making it difficult to verify successful email delivery or troubleshoot failures.

Cause
Incorrect handling of the email response object â€” emailResponse.data?.id was either not accessed or not logged correctly.

Resolution
Updated the function to correctly access and log the emailResponse.data.id, ensuring complete and accurate logs.

Outcome
âœ… Improved visibility into email delivery
âœ… Easier debugging and monitoring of confirmation emails
âœ… More dependable and transparent confirmation process
